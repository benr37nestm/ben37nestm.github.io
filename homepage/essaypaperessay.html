Lower East Side - For the under-representation of most of what NYC has to offer
<br><br>
Growing up in the Upper East Side, not having many visits to other parts of the city, even some in Manhattan, made experiencing new parts of the city seem abnormal. I wasn’t aware of the difference between where I grew up and where other people in the city have. My first time going to Nest was when I went to see my brother’s music recital, and I remember being so confused with my surroundings. I thought that every part of Manhattan was organized and looked the same regardless of where you were. But in the Lower East Side, there were no numbers on the street signs, no tall buildings, and spray paint all over the walls. I remember there being many more local stores than where I lived, run by families just trying to support themselves and give back to the community. There was nothing like that where I lived. There were only very global and centralized stores that were available anywhere else in the country. It didn’t have the same feeling to it. The difference between going into a Panera Bread and getting a slice of pizza from the store on the corner for one dollar was who it’s run by: locals or a franchise. While franchises have more well known and popular food, there’s nothing better than some good locally-produced food, and I will choose the hole-in-the-wall pizza place over Papa Johns or Dominoes every time.
<br><br>
When I transferred to Nest in 7th grade, I began becoming more and more adjusted to this once very foreign environment to discover how special and historical the neighborhood is. The many different events in history that happened there; there was nothing like that where I lived.
<br><br>
One day after school, when my friend and I were waiting for a Via, there was a mass shooting in the area and they locked the doors to the school. When the Via arrived, we were unable to exit the building. I checked the citizen app to see if there was any news on the issue, and it read “three dead, six injured”. There was nothing like that where I lived. I didn’t notice or even think about violence and crimes in NYC; I knew they existed and occurred, but given that they’ve never occurred even anywhere near me before going to this school made this kind of event all the more impactful in how I see the world as a whole.
<br><br>
I wonder where I would be in life if I didn’t change schools. If I didn’t move from staying on the Upper East side to being on the Lower East Side, my outlook on life would be immensely different. The change in my environment and surroundings helped shape me into the person I am today. The way I perceive society is that I see beauty and life in any part of the world. Whether it’s a five-story mansion in Beverly Hills or Hamilton Fish park, where I would often see pools with no water, or homeless people lying on benches chain-smoking a whole pack of cigarettes, there's still more to it than what meets the eye. There is always an origin of the place’s creation, many different people that have walked the same ground, and many changes may have been made before its current form.
<br><br>
Regardless of where I am in New York City every place is beautiful and unique in its way, and regardless of how it may look on the outside, you have to remember that what may seem foreign and obscure to you is normal to others. There is a wide array of feelings you can have going to any part of New York, but the only feeling that stays is the feeling of happiness. The feeling of where you are is worth more to others than it is to you. I feel like that’s why living in NYC is so expensive; more than the career opportunities or the popularity, the feeling of being among others just trying to live out their best lives, the feeling of being in a place that may be more special and meaningful than it is to you. That’s the real price tag of NYC: the feeling of being in NYC, which is like no other.
